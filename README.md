# Description
This GitHub repository was created as part of the team "Canes" group project for the Bioinformatics Tools course (BIL 652/552) at the University of Miami.

The repository includes the bioinformatics pipeline (available as a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamCanes/blob/main/notebook/main_pipeline.ipynb)) that provides functional and comparative genomic analysis of unknown sequences. Pipeline documentation (link) includes Tutorial (link) on how to use the pipeline with the example data (here).
