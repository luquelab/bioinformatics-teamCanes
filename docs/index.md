# bioinformatics-teamCanes

## Description

This GitHub pages is overview of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamCanes) created as part of the team "Canes" group project for the Bioinformatics Tools course (BIL 652/552) at the University of Miami.

The repository includes the bioinformatics pipeline (available as a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamCanes/blob/main/notebooks/main_pipeline.ipynb)) that provides a user-friendly, reproducible, and comprehensive framework for functional and comparative genomic analysis of unknown sequences. Designed to run entirely in Google Colab, the pipeline enables researchers and students to upload and analyze DNA sequences without requiring complex local installations.

## Folders' Description
