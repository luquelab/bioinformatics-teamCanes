## Tutorial

This tutorial provides an overview of running project's bioinformatics pipeline on a [sample data](https://github.com/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamCanes/tree/main/examples/sequences.fasta) obtained from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The expected output is provided in [examples/output](https://github.com/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamCanes/tree/main/examples/output) folder and can be downloaded as a .zip file to a local machine. 

## Running the Bioinformatics Pipeline via Google Colab

1. Open the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamCanes/blob/main/notebooks/main_pipeline.ipynb) containing the Bioinformatics Pipeline. The pipeline is composed of multiple well documented steps explaining performed analyses and resulting output files.  
2. In the top menu, select `Runtime` > `Run all` to run the whole pipeline. IMPORTANT: Even if you elect to run the pipeline this way, you will need to scroll to the bottom of the cell that uploads sequences and manually upload sequences from the local machine as in **Step 3** of this tutorial. Alternatively, run code blocks one by one starting with the top block that installs packages required for proper functioning of the pipeline.  
3. Navigate to **Part 1. Step 1: Upload and Store Sequences File** and upload the fasta file with sample DNA sequences when prompted. (When you run this cell block you will need to manually click and upload sequences from the local machine).
4. Access and analyze generated output files as pipeline runs or wait until the whole pipeline finishes. Generated results can be viewed within the notebook or on the left side panel. It may take up to 15-30 minutes for the whole pipeline to finish running due to BLAST and HHMER searches that predict functions and organismal origin of DNA sequences of interest.   
5. The **results** folder (located in the default **project_x_analysis** directory, if the name of the root directory was not modified by the user) contains sub-folders with output analyses performed at different steps of the pipeline.   
6. Download individual output files from their corresponding directories or download the whole generated output directory (**project_x_analysis** or **project_x_analysis/results**) adding and running the following code block at the end of the pipeline:
<pre> ```   
import shutil

# Define the folder path
folder_path = "/content/project_x_analysis"

# Zip the folder
shutil.make_archive(folder_path, 'zip', folder_path)

# Download the zipped folder
from google.colab import files
files.download(folder_path + ".zip")

``` </pre>
7. Compare your results with the output provided in [examples/output](https://github.com/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamCanes/tree/main/examples/output) folder.
